Sapling Gem
===========

Sapling lets you seed your new features to just a few users at a time. You can change which and how many users are
seeded for a feature dynamically by updating the database via the Sapling API. Core features are the ability to
seed a feature for specific users and/or a percentage of users.

Heritage
--------

This is a port of the [Rollout Gem](https://github.com/jamesgolick/rollout) for
use with ActiveRecord instead of Redis. We dropped the groups functionality.
